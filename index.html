        <h3>About US</h3>
        <p><span id="abouthead">HOPE CHARITY ORGANIZATION</span> is an non profit organisation which is consistently working for the betterment of orphans.</p>
        <p>There are a staggering number of orphan children worldwide. In fact, more than 140 million children are considered
        orphans by one definition or another. Sadly, there are orphan children who are even abandoned by the statistics! Who
        counts those who live on the streets, in landfills and sewer systems?</p>
        <h4>Why do such little numbers reach orphanages?</h4>
        <p>The answer is simple: because there is little infrastructure or for these orphan children. One in five districts in the country does not have even a single orphanage, and majority districts donâ€™t have the minimum three orphanages needed (one for children of less than 6 years of age and one each for boys and girls of 6-18 years respectively). Orphans and vulnerable children do not even have separate legislation in India, they are part of the Juvenile Justice Act. The primary focus being under 18 criminals, even in the law that should protect them, they are lost. This historical neglect could have arisen for many reasons. In India, there are always more beneficiaries and claimants than funds, and orphans and destitute children have no one speaking for them.</p>
        <h4>Why Help Orphans?</h4>
        <p>Whether you are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or just a caring person who loves children
        and recognizes our responsibility to the orphan children of the world...or both, there is no greater impact you can have
        on the future of our planet, than you will have by caring for our greatest resource, the innocent and deserving children
        who have been left to suffer. There are more than 140 million of them. Don't you think they will have an impact on our
        world?</p>
